<h1> Why? </h1>
        I am a DSST Knights student athlete and really love the game of basketball. I started playing basketball at 12 years old but at first it was just something I thought was cool.
        I didn't take it serious until the following year when I actually started to develope as a basketball player. Kobe Bryant was a huge infleunce for
        me when I started to play basketball and that is why I chose to make this web page about Kobe
        Bryant. Growing up and even to this day he is my favorite basketball player of all time.
        One thing that made Kobe Bryant such a large influence on me was his passion and desire to be the best.
        I saw that same competitiveness in myself, as I always have strived and continue to be the best
