<p>
  Kobe Bryant's 20 season career came to a devastating end in the 2015-2016 when he announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season.
  His season prior to that last season were filled with injuries and his age really did start to show in his health and in his game. In the end of the 2014-2015 season Kobe Bryant tore his right Achillies in the final minutes of a very important Warriors-Lakers game.
  His final season he averaged 17.6 points per game and ended his career with a 60 point game against the Utah Jazz.
  Kobe was celebrated and honored before and after the game as he holds the record for most seasons played with one team.
   Kobe spent a good amount of his season injured and sidelined with shoulder injuries and with a knee injury but Kobe did make a point
   to play his final away games in all the different cities to allow the fans to pay their farewells.

<h2 class="lifeafterball"> Life After Basketball </h2>
  <p>
    In an interview with Kobe Bryant, he discusses his plans after he retires from the NBA. He discusses how he intends
    to spend time with his 2 daughters and will continue to stay in shape even if he is not currently playing. Kobe Bryant became a
    commentator for professional basketball after he retired so that he could stay around the game and still be involved. He also stated in one of post game interviews after his amazing 60 point that he would have strong interest
    in joining the front office for an organization and even possibly coaching at the NBA level.

<p>
      This compassionate side of Kobe was a side of him that people were not accustomed to seeing out of him
      and his retirement was really a turning point for the reputation that he had. People realized that he was not just Kobe "The asshole" or the "over competitor" "The arrogant guy" but
      he received the recognition as the "Father" and the "Provider" and even as a "Businessman" which were different aspects of Kobe's life that
      not many people acknowledged him.
